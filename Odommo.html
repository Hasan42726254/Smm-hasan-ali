   	          	 <td> <p style="color:white"><strong>Bangladeshis </strong> of varying background all over the country were asked why they think poverty persists to such an extent in Bangladesh. Their answers provide a new perspective on the situation. The initial response often blames outside and natural causes -- floods, droughts, lack of resources, low demand for the country's exports, or historic exploitation. It is true that Bangladesh has virtually no mineral resources except gas. Yet, the soil, water, and human labor add up to a huge potential. The Third Five Year Plan emphasizes use of the soil, irrigation, tanks, rivers, and human labor. These provide the only hope for reducing poverty a little during the next 5 years. Bangladeshis as well as foreign observers most commonly cite overpopulation as the cause of poverty. Population growth is a cause of present poverty in Bangladesh but is not the only cause of poverty. The Third Five Year Plan goal to reduce annual growth to 1.8% is ambitious, but even if it is achieved the population will double in a few decades. As it would most likely be impossible for Bangladesh to support such numbers and maintain political and economic stability, such growth will have to be prevented. Poverty in Bangladesh is party a result of the long history of low urbanization, weak institutions, spotty and inadequate physical infrastructure, and insufficient entrapreneurship.</td>

         	<table><tr><td><p style="color:white">Other reasons cited as causes of persisting poverty include illiteracy, idleness, class exploitation, the selfishness of individuals, and a lack of trust among people. All of the efforts of the poor themselves, various agencies, and the government, as examined in the 1st part of this discussion, fail to indicate any reason to hope that poverty in Bangladesh can be dramatically reduced any time soon. The Third Five Year Plan foresees a possible reduction of the number of those in poverty by 10%. According to the Plan itself, those in or near poverty comprise 85% of the people. The conditions under which the people of some East Asian countries have virtually propelled themselves into a more dynamic economic situation simply do not exist in Bangladesh. Yet, by taking a long view of Bangladesh and its human history, some aspects appear bright. If the human population and the land resources are brought into a better equilibrium, the potential for a very large population to be supported on the land almost indefinitely, and without destroying the resource base, is much greater than in most parts of the world. The expressive culture and complex network of personal relations will continue to make life rich despite material poverty. The individualism which impedes the growth of stable institutions is beginning to exert itself in entrepreneurship. Finally, the government and the aid agencies are now on a track of "development" that is consistent with the realities of the Bengali peasant tradition.</p></td><td><img src="download.webp"  height="300"  width="400"></td></tr>
